  Great job creating an entertaining sketch! I liked your use of different scenes and how you showed the process of making a burger. The interactions were also creative.

  One point of improvement would have been to have more animations and sound to make your sketch more engaging. Particularly in the final scene, it would have been nice to have more animated elements to really catch one's attention.
